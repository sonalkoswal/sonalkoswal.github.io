                            Learning graphology with Sonal has been a wonderful experience. Often heard my friends doing graphology complaining about how their mentors were not very approachable and often lead them harbouring doubts and misunderstandings. My experience is very different, and mentor is very much approachable and friendly ,creating a Informal atmosphere, giving space for valuable interaction which is essential for the subject of this nature. The course is designed so systematically as to cover all the nuances of the subject. Special mention for the advanced course which along with graphology is designed to include self stabilising techniques of meditation. Lastly, to all those who still underestimate the importance of the handwriting , All i would say it is an immensely powerful instrument. A change in your handwriting has the ability to transform you. Experience it to see it work! Cheers!

                            I am fortunate to have learnt graphology from Sonal. I did both basic and advanced level of graphology with her and a workshop on drawing analysis as well. She is an excellent trainer and guide. Unlike other trainers, Sonal makes sure to follow up on her students and keep them updated with the new techniques in graphology. She also tries her best to give her students as much exposure as she can. She takes her students to a number of workshops with her so they can get some hands-on experience. I think more than a trainer and a guide, she is a great human being and is always there to help you.

My understanding of situations and people has changed, I'm much happier, and whenever faced with any problem Sonal Maam has always been there.
                            I recommend it to everyone, cause trust me it will change you in the best way possible and learning this skill is a boon

                            others, this is the best place from where you can start. 
                            I had been trying from so long to implement changes in my life and just start a
                            new life, I had also consulted many therapists but nothing worked. One session
                            with Sonal mam, and I felt so good and really better. 
                            Also the techniques and notes that Sonal mam gave for Graphology course is
                            something which you will never find anywhere. 
                            I came down from Mumbai to Pune to learn Graphology from her, and yes it
                            was really worth it. I really thank her to change my life as well to help me
                            understand graphology from totally a different perspective.
