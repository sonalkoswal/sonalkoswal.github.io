                            Learning graphology with Sonal has been a wonderful experience. Often heard my friends doing graphology complaining about how their mentors were not very approachable and often lead them harbouring doubts and misunderstandings. My experience is very different, and mentor is very much approachable and friendly ,creating a Informal atmosphere, giving space for valuable interaction which is essential for the subject of this nature. The course is designed so systematically as to cover all the nuances of the subject. Special mention for the advanced course which along with graphology is designed to include self stabilising techniques of meditation. Lastly, to all those who still underestimate the importance of the handwriting , All i would say it is an immensely powerful instrument. A change in your handwriting has the ability to transform you. Experience it to see it work! Cheers!

                            Graphology is one of the fastest diagnostic tool that we have encountered in our institute. Sonal is the best exponent of this tool. She has an uncanny knack of being 99.9% correct with her graphology readings. Her therapy plans have helped over hundred patients at our centre. We have only one word to say when it comes to Sonal's graphology skills "Grateful".

                            I am fortunate to have learnt graphology from Sonal. I did both basic and advanced level of graphology with her and a workshop on drawing analysis as well. She is an excellent trainer and guide. Unlike other trainers, Sonal makes sure to follow up on her students and keep them updated with the new techniques in graphology. She also tries her best to give her students as much exposure as she can. She takes her students to a number of workshops with her so they can get some hands-on experience. I think more than a trainer and a guide, she is a great human being and is always there to help you.

                            I studied graphology from Sonal Maam over a year ago, and this year has transformed my thinking towards myself and others in an incredible way. My understanding of situations and people has changed, I'm much happier, and whenever faced with any problem Sonal Maam has always been there.
                            I recommend it to everyone, cause trust me it will change you in the best way possible and learning this skill is a boon
